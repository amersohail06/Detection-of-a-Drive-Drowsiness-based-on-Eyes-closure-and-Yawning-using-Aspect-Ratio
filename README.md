# Detection-of-a-Drive-Drowsiness-based-on-Eyes-closure-and-Yawning-using-Aspect-Ratio

The key methodology involves employing the HAAR Cascade algorithm for facial detection, a robust technique for identifying objects in images or video. In conjunction, a supplementary cascade file containing features specific to eyes, nose, and mouth aids in pinpointing these crucial facial landmarks. Subsequently, the aspect ratio of these landmarks is calculated and compared against predefined threshold values. If the aspect ratio surpasses the specified thresholds for any of the facial features, a drowsiness alert is triggered on the display screen.
